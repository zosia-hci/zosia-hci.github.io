# Problem
Our phones provide us with all the connections - to our friends, to social media, entertrainment, and so on. Phones, as computational machines, are also able to collect the data of our usage. Many phones offer insights about the usage of our screen time and options to limit it -- but is  it effective?
We want to find a more sustainable way to improve screen time usage, balancing productivity and personal entertrainment.


# Interview
We interviewed 7 university students (5 undergraduates, 1 graduate, 1 exchange student).

## Target Audience
Our audience is university students whose productivity, sleeping health, and daily lives are impacted by phone usage, and wish to reduce it.

## Interview Structure
Our goal is to learn how could we improve sleeping habits, provide less distraction and increase productivity amongst university students. We hope that university students will start caring about screen time data. 
Therefore, our questions are divided into following categories:
* <b>Sharing data</b><br>
| Sharing data of last month screen time and notification data
* <b>General well-being</b><br>
| How are their sleep habits, anxiety, time-schedule? How does their phone contribute to that?
* <b>Phone settings</b><br>
| Do they use any settings filtering notifications? Do they limit their app usage?
* <b>Habits</b><br>
| How do they use phone in social situations, during their day, during class?
* <b>User Expectations</b><br>
| What do they expect? Which data are they interested in? 



## Result Summary
* Users do not want to <b>revolutionize</b> their phone usage habits, but engage in <b>small-step activities</b> to improve their life quality like sleep and productivity.
* Users wish to <b>balance</b> the phone usage for both productivity and leisure.
* They want to maintain a <b>distinct boundary</b> between productivity and leisure, and not switch between those two back and forth.
