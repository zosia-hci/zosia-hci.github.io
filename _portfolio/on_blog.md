Current creators on Naver platform have a lack of sense of accomplishment. With our solution, we want to strengthen the creators identity, create a platform for building relationships with other creators, and allow creators to show their indentity in the process.

온(on) blog is a new type of blogging system supporting a creator to find and strengthen one's own identity asa creator through active cooperation with other creators.
The "온" in 온 blog means: 👐온: 모든, ⤵️ON: 위, ☀️溫(온) : 따뜻한 (english: everything, up, warm).

The 온 blog proposes a new system structure to enhance sense of accomplishment in the process of collaboration. The first system, 열린 포스트 (an open post), allows the owner of the post to invite all other creators to fill-in the content their posts need in a form of a "call to collaborate". The other system, 열린 글모임 (an open writing meeting), is for established collaborators, who need a system to facilitate smoother collaborations in the editing environment of Naver blog. 


This project was conducted as a part of System Design course at ID KAIST, thanks to Naver. The project was a result of a team effort from Jian Jun, Jeongjae Lee, Hyerim Hwang, Zofia Marciniak, Adil Hassan Khan.
