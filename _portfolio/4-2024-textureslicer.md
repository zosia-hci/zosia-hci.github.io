When working on Texture Slicer for over one and a half year, I went through both ups and downs. This poster was made when pushing this project forward felt difficult, and as a distraction I decided to play around in Illustrator.

Putting all the pieces together, along with my favourite fonts and colors, helped me restore my passion and finish the paper. And also, I ended up with this very cool poster!
