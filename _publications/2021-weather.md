In the urban area, there are many activity choices such as shopping or staying home. One of the main factors which affects people’s choices is the weather. In this study, the influence of weather conditions on human activity in the urban area is explored. We trace the change in the intensity of the mobile LTE access usage under different weather conditions. We find that pressure and rain are the most impactful conditions, while most affected groups are people in their 20’s and older. People in their 30’s seem to be the least affected and follow their usual activity pattern. Our result can provide insights for spot recommendation, traffic prediction, and sales prediction.
