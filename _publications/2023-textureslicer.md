This paper introduces a novel workflow of 3D printing various finish patterns of an object without CAD modelling an actual surface texture but computationally generating a gcode for 3D printing with an embedded texture. It allows designers to easily convert a simple 3D surface to a textured surface they desire. In this paper, we describe how our slicer generates texture patterns from a given geometry and 3D print 40 samples of textured surfaces to explore the texture design spectrum of our slicer. We also present three applications to demonstrate the feasibility of our texture slicer.
