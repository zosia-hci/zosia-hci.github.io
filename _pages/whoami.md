    <h1 align="left">Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I’m Zofia, but everyone calls me Zosia (Zoh-see-ah, or 조시아). I’m a second-year master’s student at KAIST, studying Industrial Design. I work in the field of Human-Computer Interaction with Professor Andrea Bianchi, and my research focuses on digital fabrication and crafting technologies.</p>
    <p>I’m all about inding ways to bring <b>traditional crafting and modern tech</b> together. In my work, I want to help crafters digitize their processes, making it easier to record and share their work in new and exciting ways. I love exploring how technology can fit seamlessly into creative workflows without taking away the personal touch.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about designing tools that are intuitive and meaningful for the crafting community. If you’re into crafting, digital fabrication, or just love talking, let’s connect—I’d love to chat!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I crochet (<a href="/fun/">duh</a>), solve sudokus, do puzzles, or style outfits with my crochet pieces. For a bit more adrenaline, I travel the world with my older sister. </p>
