      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>I'm Zofia, but everyone calls me Zosia (Zoh-see-ah, or 조시아). I'm a second-year master's student at KAIST, studying Industrial Design. I work in the field of Human-Computer Interaction with Professor Andrea Bianchi, and my research focuses on digital fabrication and crafting technologies.</p>
      <p>I'm all about finding ways to bring <strong>traditional crafting and modern tech</strong> together. In my work, I want to help crafters digitize their processes, making it easier to record and share their work in new and exciting ways. I love exploring how technology can fit seamlessly into creative workflows without taking away the personal touch.</p>
      <p>I'm passionate about designing tools that are intuitive and meaningful for the crafting community. If you're into crafting, digital fabrication, or just love talking, let's connect—I'd love to chat!</p>
      <p>I spend my free time crocheting (<a href="/fun/">duh</a>), solving sudokus, doing puzzles, and bouldering. For a bit more adrenaline, I travel the world with my older sister.</p>
